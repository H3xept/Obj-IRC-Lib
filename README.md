# Obj-IRC –– jndok's branch
Simple IRC protocol implementation, in *(almost)* pure Objective-C.

## A few warning words
Before you start dumping this lib into your code, please realize that is is purely an experimental thing I'm creating with a friend of mine. So expect bugs and random errors. Also, the library is basically useless in its current state. Every branch is still being created, mine supports only 2 commands (`handshake` and `ping`).<br><br>So please be patient and we'll deliver a nice work. Thank you!

*Please not that this branch contains my own version of the library, which may differ significantly than H3xept's one or from the `master` branch.*
